# EECS2022-verilog-riscv

This is a repository of the Verilog Pre-labs for EECS2022 which is a second year course taught in York University

I had taken this course in Winter 2022 where there was a lot of content to cover in a short period of time. Including myself many students had struggles  

Thus, I am providing my completed versions of the pre-labs with the hope that others can benefit from the struggles that I and my fellow classmates had to go through to determine how to make this work. Credit has been given to co-authors in comments.

Previous GitHubs published for this course were for a version of the course that used MIPS as the ISA. However, the course has been taught using the RISC-V instruction set since around 2017; thus, the code provided in those older GitHubs are not a 1:1 resource that can be used by current students.

The corresponding pre-lab handouts can be found at this page: https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/teaching/docs/2021/

The prelabs for Verilog are K, L, M, and N.
